## What is a pattern?

A pattern is a room template that can be used in dungeon generation. Zirok has 8 basic patterns, and it will also be possible to expand. We adhere to the concept that in each room there can only be 4 doors, each of which leads in one of 4 directions (forward, left, right, back).

## Pattern 1:

The smallest pattern in the project, the chance of choosing it by default by the library is high relative to other patterns. The starting room, from which the dungeon will be built, and the player will initially spawn there, will also be of the first pattern.

This pattern looks like this:
