# Project Zirok
## What is it?
To begin with, it is worth introducing the definition of "Dungeon".
The term refers to a grid of rooms connected by doors. Quite often, dungeons are used in roguelike games, games where random level generation is needed (new start - new dungeon).
Project Zirok is a core that allows you to generate dungeons based on data entered into it (number of rooms, grid size, etc.).
