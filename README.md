# Project Zirok
## What is it?
This is the core of a dungeon (Dungeons are grids consisting of rooms connected doors) generator based on a modified Random Walk algorithm. In this project, we followed the idea of ​​separating the core and the user interface. This means that the Zirok core can be easily integrated into your project. We used a small QT/C++ application to demonstrate the features of the Zirok core.
