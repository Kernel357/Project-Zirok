# Project Zirok
## What is it?
To begin with, it is worth introducing the definition of "Dungeon".
The term refers to a grid of rooms connected by doors. Quite often, dungeons are used in roguelike games, games where random level generation is needed (new start - new dungeon).
Project Zirok is a core that allows you to generate dungeons based on data entered into it (number of rooms, grid size, etc.).

## Status:
So far, not much has been implemented. Currently running:
- Support for 1 of 8 basic [patterns](https://github.com/Kernel357/Zirok/blob/main/Docs/Patterns.md) (the number of patterns will increase)
- Configurable grid size
- Configurable number of rooms
- Scripts for building the core into a static library Linux (for subsequent integration of the library into your project)

## How to use?
Soon...

## Gratitudes:
For the early renders of the dungeons (graphical output does not exist yet), I want to say thanks to this person: ZIPPI#6320 (discord)
